Now that collecting information is easier than ever, most industries have already generated *time-series* type problems by the way that they store data. As such, it is crucial to be able to handle data in this form. Thankfully, built-in functionality from [Featuretools](https://www.featuretools.com) handles time varying data well.\n","\n","We'll demonstrate an end-to-end workflow using a [Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/#turbofan) from NASA. This notebook demonstrates a rapid way to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an engine using an initial dataframe of time-series data. There are three sections of the notebook:\n","1. [Understand the Data](#Step-1:-Understanding-the-Data)\n","2. [Generate features](#Step-2:-DFS-and-Creating-a-Model)\n","3. [Make predictions with Machine Learning](#Step-3:-Using-the-Model)\n","\n","*To run the notebooks, you need to download the data yourself. Download and unzip the file from [https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/13/](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/6/). Then create a 'data' directory and place the files in the 'data' directory.*\n","\n","\n","## Highlights\n","* Quickly make end-to-end workflow using time-series data\n","* Find interesting
